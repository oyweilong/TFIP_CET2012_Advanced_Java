## Practicum 1

### A company wants to develop a small tool that is able to store some employee data into a file.
This tool allows users to **add, list, update, delete** and **undo the previous instruction.**
In addition, this tool is able to load from a saved file at startup (if any) and store its content to a file after all commands have been executed, analogous to a cashier entering items to an Point of Sales machine or calling up a previous transaction then generating a receipt.
